GoSublime Notes
---------------

## GoSublime Replacement

### Syntax:
	* Breaks when the GoSublime package is replaced or symlinked.
	* Used by view.set_syntax_file() to override the defaul Go syntax
	* Solution: make sure paths are correct
		* There are probably many more path related errors here...
